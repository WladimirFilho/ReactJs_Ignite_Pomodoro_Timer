<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The Pomodoro Timer is a web-based productivity tool designed to help users efficiently manage their time and enhance productivity. Inspired by the Pomodoro Technique, this timer allows users to break down work into focused intervals, known as "Pomodoros," separated by short breaks. This technique is widely used to improve time management, maintain focus, and reduce burnout.
